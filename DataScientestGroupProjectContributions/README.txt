This is a collection of the notebooks that I contributed to the group project, which can be viewed at https://github.com/DataScientest-Studio/amazon_review.

These files represent my coding methods and uniwue approach to problems. In the project group there are two group members, myself and LukasTopinka (Listed in contributors.)
The final contributor is MaÃ«lys Bassilekin Blanc, who is our group supervisor and guide to help us generate a project of value.

The project compares the ability of classification and Regression techniques to predict the rating associated with amazon reviews. Lukas and I preprocessed teh data by creating
custom functions for Text Lemmatization and Stemmatization, CountVector Vectorizing and TFIDF Vectorizing. I contributed the stemmatization and CountVector functions which can be
found in this directory. I also standardized the functions to receive and return the same data types and created the TextMiningProcesses.py file which collates our standardized work.

While Lukas tackled the Classification modelling, I spearheaded the Regression Analyses in the 02InitialRegressionAttempts notebook and the 03AdditionalRegressionAnalysis notebooks. 
All work here in these file versions is my own, the files may differ from the group project where we adjust the content to better represent the project goals.
