The work in the 'Recurrent NN PyTorch.py' file is a recreation of code from the lessons at DataScientest.com

As I recreated the code from the module to ensure I understood it and coulfd recreate it, I discovered that the generate_samples function was provided by a private py file that we did not have access. So while I do not usually post my module recreations to my portfolio, I uploaded this one, because the generate_samples function was written fro mscratch, based on the context given in the code alone.

I am happy with how it produces full words from characters! The 'Docker Remarks.txt' was generated by me in a sepearate module and it describes my thought process as I approached the Docker Coursework. Using this text as input provides a very limited corpus, but it is still satisfying to see how key words like Docker and API image are easily reproduced by the model. It is also interesting to see how many samples result in loops of similar phrases, another symptom of the reduced corpus I suspect!
